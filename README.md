# Essence of Creation
It is said that nestled deeply in every human creation is a spark, a quantum of creation imbued ito the object by merit of being created. It is this spark that enables materials to come together into more complex systems. Without it, bricks would revert to clay, glass to sand, torches into wood and coal. It is termed Essence of Creation.

For ages Essence of Creation has been irretrievably locked away, but no longer. With the power of the Essential Extractor and Essential Infuser, the common man can harness its massive power for their own purposes. What are you waiting for? There's discovery to be done.
